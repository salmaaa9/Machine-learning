# Machine-learning
this repository contains some of my machine learning projects utilizing the pandas numpy and matplotlib libraries

kmeans and clustering project
this project focuses on the effect of clustering when using k means  with dimentionality reduction and and its significance where i make comparison between using kmeans without PCA and with wich clearly the superior method is with PCA

neural network
is a nural network adaptation wich focuses on the infamous problem of recognizing a digit from a picture while using tenserflow and experimenting with diffrent values for the batch size and numbers of epochs 

smoker or not smoker
this project focuses on feature engineering where creation of interaction term between the features which have high correlation then checking for missing values and normalization and ensomple methods using bagging boosting and random forest also the optimization of hyperparameters further refines model's performance. using grid search and cross-validation

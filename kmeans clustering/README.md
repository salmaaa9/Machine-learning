The concepts used :
• Introducing dimensionality reduction through PCA.
• Introducing Clustering through K-means.
• Evaluate the impact of dimensionality reduction on clustering results.
•implementing k-means and PCA manually without using scikit learn.

Problem Statement 
Given the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, the objective is to perform unsupervised 
clustering to identify inherent patterns or groupings within the dataset. This dataset contains features 
computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNAs) of breast masses, aiming to distinguish 
between malignant and benign tumors.

 First experiment: shows Clustering of the dataset using k-means then applying the elbow method to find the best Number.
 Second experiment: Apply PCA then cluster the dataset using k-means then also applying the elbow method to find the best Number.

• The Comparison between the sum of square errors shows significant reduction after dimentionality reduction using OCA is applied.

Problem Statement
Smoking remains a significant contributor to various health complications and is responsible for 
preventable illnesses and millions of deaths globally, with projections indicating a surge to 10 million 
smoking-related deaths by 2030. Despite concerted efforts, the complexity of factors influencing 
smoking cessation has hindered high success rates in quitting.
To address this challenge, the problem at hand is to utilize machine learning to predict an individual's 
smoking status using bio-signals. The objective is to create a predictive model that considers multiple 
factors such as nicotine dependency, carbon monoxide levels, daily cigarette consumption, age of 
smoking initiation, previous quit attempts, emotional well-being, personality traits, and motivation to 
quit. This model aims to assist healthcare professionals and individuals in assessing the likelihood of 
successfully quitting smoking, thereby improving smoking cessation outcomes.

1. Data Analysis:
• Univariate Analysis: Understanding the distribution and characteristics of individual 
features provides crucial insights into their relevance and potential impact on model 
performance. This analysis aids in identifying which features might be significant for 
further manipulation in Feature Engineering
• Bivariate Analysis: Examining relationships between pairs of features helps identify 
dependencies or correlations. These identified patterns guide the selection of feature 
combinations that might contribute significantly to model performance during Feature 
Engineering.
• Multivariate Analysis: Assessing complex interactions among multiple features offers a 
deeper understanding of their combined effects. This analysis assists in feature selection 
and dimensionality reduction techniques employed in Feature Engineering.

2. Feature Engineering and Preprocessing:
• Techniques for Feature Engineering: Leveraging insights from Univariate, Bivariate, and 
Multivariate Analyses, techniques for extracting, creating, and selecting features are 
employed. This step involves transforming raw data into meaningful representations that 
positively impact model accuracy and performance.
• Exploration of Feature Impacts: Hands-on exercises involving the manipulation of 
features based on data analysis findings provide a practical understanding of how 
feature modifications directly influence model outcomes.

3. Ensemble Methods:
the following ensemble methods are utilized:
• Bagging: Utilizes bootstrapping to train multiple models independently and combines 
their predictions through averaging or voting.
• Boosting: Builds a sequence of models, each correcting errors made by the previous 
ones by assigning different weights to data instances.
• Random Forests: Implement a Random Forest class or functions to combine multiple 
Decision trees using the DecisionTreeClassifier from scikit-learn.
These ensemble techniques leverage the enhanced features and models created through 
Feature Engineering. The refined features and diverse models contribute to improved predictive 
accuracy and robustness when combined using these ensemble methods.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning:
• Grid Search: Exhaustively searches through a specified parameter grid to identify the 
best combination of hyperparameters.
• Randomized Search: Randomly samples hyperparameters from specified distributions to 
efficiently find optimal settings
